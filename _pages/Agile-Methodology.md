# CFPB Values and Agile Values

CFPB's values - Lead, Serve, Innovate - are strong influences on our Agile practices. Our own Agile values, as written in this document, represent an integration of the CFPB's values with the values of the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/).

## __Individuals and interactions over processes and tools__
* Innovation starts with people and their needs - both consumers and our team members. We serve by leading (and vice-versa).
* By valuing individuals, we can both serve and lead those individuals more effectively.
* We should not justify the use of any process or tool simply because "we've always done it that way."

## __Working software over comprehensive documentation__
* In order to best serve the public and our coworkers, we must produce working software and iterate on that software.
* We value demonstrating the capabilities of a product via working versions of that product.
* We value documentation and retaining institutional knowledge, but no document can describe a product as well as a working version can demonstrate it.

## __Customer collaboration over contract negotiation__
* The best path to serving the public is to collaborate closely with internal and external stakeholders, subject matter experts, and others who can help us iterate to develop better products.
* Servant-leadership requires finding ways to collaborate to constructive ends, to focus on shared values to decide upon shared goals, and to communicate effectively with any and all collaborators.
* We value in-depth, close collaboration instead of detailed documents or memorandums. By focusing on shared goals, we can serve and satisfy stakeholders without the need for strict contracts.

## __Responding to change over following a plan__
* While we expect change, we can never fully anticipate what changes may come. Changes can come from new information about consumer or coworker needs, from usability research, or from the ever-changing consumer markets themselves.
* We value turning each unexpected change into an opportunity to improve our product. What is important is not the change itself, but our response to the change.
* Innovation requires thoughtful, constructive responses when changes come from outside the team. In this way, innovating creates leadership and service opportunities, where we can both trail-blaze new ways to solve problems and new ways to serve consumers and coworkers.
