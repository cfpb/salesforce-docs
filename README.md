It establishes the standards, controls, and guidance
that enforce technical quality of the platform and product work that goes into CFPB’s Salesforce platform. It also describes the primary interfaces between the Enterprise Platforms Team (aka the CoE - Center of Excellence)
and the various Product Teams building application solutions on the Salesforce platform.

 - Operational instructions for how to get support; e.g., how to set up a developer sandbox; how to reset your password
 - How to integrate with third-party systems
 - A list of CFPB applications or products
