 - Deployment pipelines practices (continuous integration)


#### What this is **not*:

Other things to include:

  - **Technology stack**: Indicate the technological nature of the software, including primary programming language(s) and whether the software is intended as standalone or as a module in a framework or other ecosystem.
  - **Status**:  Alpha, Beta, 1.1, etc. It's OK to write a sentence, too. The goal is to let interested people know where this project is at. This is also a good place to link to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

  - Describe what sets this apart from related-projects. Linking to another doc or page is OK if this can't be expressed in a sentence or two.
